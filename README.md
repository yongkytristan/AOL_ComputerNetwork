# AOL_ComputerNetwork

This was the final project for the Computer Network course, where we were required to design and connect the network infrastructure across three floors of Binus University. Our group specifically chose Binus Anggrek floors 3, 4, and 5.
The project was implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, with the requirements to configure end devices, routers, switches, and servers. My main role in this project was to set up the IP configuration and ensure smooth communication between devices across all three floors.
Through this project, I learned how to apply fundamental concepts of network topology, routing, and IP addressing, as well as how to troubleshoot and optimize a network system to ensure reliability and scalability.
